    <h1>Scooby doo</h1>
    <p>My pet avator is called Scooby Doo. Brown and fluffy.Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not <br> simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 <br> years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up <br> one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the <br> cites of the word in classical</p>
    <p>Scooby doo just got a new tat literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from <br> sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, <br> written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. <br> The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
    <p>Scooby is the type of avator you just can ..It is a long established fact that a reader will be <br> distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is <br> that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here'<br>, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now <br> use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web <br> sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, <br> sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
